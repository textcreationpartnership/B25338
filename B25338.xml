            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>David</hi> we read had enemies</l>

               <l>who is fair <hi>Englands</hi> joy.</l>
               <l>In <hi>May</hi> it was the twenty nine,</l>
               <l>King <hi>Charles</hi> of high Renown.</l>
               <l>Being his birth-day (as 'tis known)</l>
               <l>to <hi>London</hi> came to town.</l>
               <l>But had you sÃ©en the tryumph made,</l>

               <l>with honest Mistris <hi>Lane,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>From <hi>Scotland</hi> he to <hi>Worcester came</hi>
               </l>
               <l>though friends did look about,</l>
               <l>Yet <hi>Cromwel</hi> came with a mighty Force</l>
               <l>and did give him the Rout.</l>
               <l>A journey lone I am sure he had</l>
               <l>with frinds the loving <hi>Scot,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>King <hi>Charles</hi> mounting himself so brave,</l>
               <l>three times his Horse was shot.</l>
               <l>The King did therefore for his safety,</l>
               <l>make friends to have some pitty,</l>
               <l>For so our Saviour he doth say</l>
               <l>as I write in this Ditty:</l>
               <l>If persecution being great,</l>
               <l>of such then have a care,</l>
               <l>So at that time 'tis very true</l>
               <l>one did cut off his Hair.</l>
               <l>His Princely cloaths he off did strip,</l>
               <l>and did himself disguise,</l>
               <l>So of King <hi>Alfred</hi> I have read,</l>
               <l>that was a Prince most wise.</l>
               <l>A Chain of gold that he had then,</l>
               <l>worth hundreds without doubt</l>
               <l>He gave away unto a friend,</l>
               <l>who lead him there about,</l>
               <l>Into a wood where Inns was none</l>
               <l>nor Lodgings there bespoke,</l>
               <l>The best of Lodgings he could get,</l>
               <l>was in a hollow Oke.</l>

               <l>Did travel towards the West.</l>
               <l>For all the Land was up in Arms</l>
               <l>in City and in Town.</l>
               <l>And for King <hi>Charles</hi> to find him out,</l>
               <l>it was a thousand pound.</l>
               <l>But Mistris <hi>Lane</hi> vertuous and wise,</l>
               <l>so much did understand,</l>

               </l>
               <l>Tor through a town they then must pass,</l>
               <l>for there was no back Lane</l>
               <l>The Horses hÃ©els then up did trip,</l>
               <l>and down fell man and Dame.</l>
               <l>The Souldiers sÃ©eing of the same,</l>
               <l>at them did laugh and jÃ©er,</l>
               <l>And she suspition for to shun,</l>
               <l>struck him a Box on the Ear.</l>

               <l>I think I am well mann'd,</l>
               <l>For such another I am sure</l>
               <l>is not within the Land,</l>
               <l>To second it her brother in Law</l>
               <l>so much in anger spoke,</l>
               <l>Well, must my Father then said he</l>
               <l>carry your mans Cloak,</l>
               <l>It was too heavy then (said she)</l>
               <l>what nÃ©ed you be so cross</l>
               <l>The burthen off it was so great</l>
               <l>it threw us off the horse.</l>
               <l>Her nimble tongue and wit in prime,</l>
               <l>and being a Lady gay,</l>
               <l>The Souldiers laughing at them then</l>
               <l>did let them pass their way,</l>
               <l>God frÃ©ed them from their Enemies</l>
               <l>For with him there is pitty,</l>

               <l>which is in <hi>Bristow</hi> City,</l>
               <l>For in the Kitchin he was plac'd</l>
               <l>by his most loving friend,</l>
               <l>And modestly he there did stand,</l>
               <l>fearing he should offend,</l>
               <l>It made the Kitchin-maid much muse,</l>

               <l>and a Naylors son.</l>
